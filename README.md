<h1>Mall Segmentation Analysis Using K-Means Clustering</h1>

<p>This project analyzes mall segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm to categorize customers based on their <strong>age</strong>, <strong>spending score</strong>, and <strong>income</strong>.</p>

<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The primary target group consists of younger customers with high income and high spending scores.</li>
  <li>The secondary target group includes younger customers with low income but high spending scores.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Business Applications</h2>
<p>We can leverage these customer clusters to refine marketing strategies and sales efforts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Young, High Income, and High Spending:</strong> Ideal for promoting luxury and premium items.</li>
  <li><strong>Young, Low Income, but High Spending:</strong> Suitable for promoting sales on regular, non-luxury products or products that are going out of season, to make room for newer inventory.</li>
</ul>
